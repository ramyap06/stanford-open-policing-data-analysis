- understanding the polars library & how to work with a large dataset
    - prompts such as "i have 2.6 gb of data, how do i only read in parts of it using polars", "how much can i read in at a time without crashing my computer", "how to collect only a certain number of rows", "can i separate filters with commas", and "how can i say for all columns get rid of rows with null values"
    - the answers i got from this helped me understand and use various polars functions such as filter(), splice(), collect(), scan_parquet(), read_parquet(), and drop_nulls()
